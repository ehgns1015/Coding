    /**
     * Runs the Rabin-Karp algorithm. This algorithms generates hashes for the
     * pattern and compares this hash to substrings of the text before doing
     * character by character comparisons.
     *
     * When the hashes are equal and you do character comparisons, compare starting
     * from the beginning of the pattern to the end, not from the end to the
     * beginning.
     *
     * You must use the Rabin-Karp Rolling Hash for this implementation. The formula
     * for it is:
     *
     * sum of: c * BASE ^ (pattern.length - 1 - i), where c is the integer value of
     * the current character, and i is the index of the character
     *
     * Note that if you were dealing with very large numbers here, your hash will
     * likely overflow. However, you will not need to handle this case. You may
     * assume there will be no overflow.
     *
     * For example: Hashing "bunn" as a substring of "bunny" with base 101 hash = b
     * * 101 ^ 3 + u * 101 ^ 2 + n * 101 ^ 1 + n * 101 ^ 0 = 98 * 101 ^ 3 + 117 *
     * 101 ^ 2 + 110 * 101 ^ 1 + 110 * 101 ^ 0 = 102174235
     *
     * Another key step for this algorithm is that updating the hashcode from one
     * substring to the next one must be O(1). To update the hash:
     *
     * remove the oldChar times BASE raised to the length - 1, multiply by BASE, and
     * add the newChar.
     *
     * For example: Shifting from "bunn" to "unny" in "bunny" with base 101
     * hash("unny") = (hash("bunn") - b * 101 ^ 3) * 101 + y = (102174235 - 98 * 101
     * ^ 3) * 101 + 121 = 121678558
     *
     * Keep in mind that calculating exponents is not O(1) in general, so you'll
     * need to keep track of what BASE^{m - 1} is for updating the hash.
     *
     * Do NOT use Math.pow() for this method.
